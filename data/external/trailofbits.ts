    "skillMd": "# Audit Context Building\n\nBuild deep architectural context through ultra-granular code analysis before vulnerability hunting.\n\n**Author:** Omar Inuwa\n\n## When to Use\n\nUse this skill when you need to:\n- Develop deep comprehension of a codebase before security auditing\n- Build bottom-up understanding instead of high-level guessing\n- Reduce hallucinations and context loss during complex analysis\n- Prepare for threat modeling or architecture review\n\n## What It Does\n\nThis skill governs how Claude thinks during the context-building phase of an audit. When active, Claude will:\n\n- Perform **line-by-line / block-by-block** code analysis\n- Apply **First Principles**, **5 Whys**, and **5 Hows** at micro scale\n- Build and maintain a stable, explicit mental model\n- Identify invariants, assumptions, flows, and reasoning hazards\n- Track cross-function and external call flows with full context propagation\n\n## Key Principle\n\nThis is a **pure context building** skill. It does NOT:\n- Identify vulnerabilities\n- Propose fixes\n- Generate proofs-of-concept\n- Assign severity or impact\n\nIt exists solely to build deep understanding before the vulnerability-hunting phase.\n\n## Installation\n\n```\n/plugin install trailofbits/skills/plugins/audit-context-building\n```\n\n## Phases\n\n1. **Initial Orientation** - Map modules, entrypoints, actors, and storage\n2. **Ultra-Granular Function Analysis** - Line-by-line semantic analysis with cross-function flow tracking\n3. **Global System Understanding** - State/invariant reconstruction, workflow mapping, trust boundaries\n\n## Anti-Hallucination Rules\n\n- Never reshape evidence to fit earlier assumptions\n- Update the model explicitly when contradicted\n- Avoid vague guesses; use \"Unclear; need to inspect X\"\n- Cross-reference constantly to maintain global coherence\n\n## Related Skills\n\n- `issue-writer` - Write up findings after context is built\n- `differential-review` - Uses context-building for baseline analysis\n- `spec-compliance` - Compare understood behavior to documentation\n"

    "skillMd": "# Constant-Time Analyzer (ct-analyzer)\n\nA portable tool for detecting timing side-channel vulnerabilities in compiled cryptographic code. Analyzes assembly output from multiple compilers and architectures to detect instructions that could leak secret data through execution timing.\n\n## Background\n\nTiming side-channel attacks exploit variations in execution time to extract secret information from cryptographic implementations. Common sources include:\n\n- **Hardware division** (`DIV`, `IDIV`): Execution time varies based on operand values\n- **Floating-point operations** (`FDIV`, `FSQRT`): Variable latency based on inputs\n- **Conditional branches**: Different execution paths have different timing\n\nThe infamous [KyberSlash](https://kyberslash.cr.yp.to/) attack demonstrated how division instructions in post-quantum cryptographic implementations could be exploited to recover secret keys.\n\n## Features\n\n- **Multi-language support**: C, C++, Go, Rust, PHP, JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Ruby\n- **Multi-architecture support**: x86_64, ARM64, ARM, RISC-V, PowerPC, s390x, i386\n- **Multi-compiler support**: GCC, Clang, Go compiler, Rustc\n- **Scripting language support**: PHP (VLD/opcache), JavaScript/TypeScript (V8 bytecode), Python (dis), Ruby (YARV)\n- **Optimization-level testing**: Test across O0-O3, Os, Oz\n- **Multiple output formats**: Text, JSON, GitHub Actions annotations\n- **Cross-compilation**: Analyze code for different target architectures\n\n## Quick Start\n\n```bash\n# Install\nuv pip install -e .\n\n# Analyze a C file\nct-analyzer crypto.c\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n### Basic Analysis\n\n```bash\nct-analyzer <source_file>\n```\n\n### Options\n\n| Option | Description |\n|--------|-------------|\n| `--arch, -a` | Target architecture (x86_64, arm64, arm, riscv64, ppc64le, s390x, i386) |\n| `--compiler, -c` | Compiler to use (gcc, clang, go, rustc) |\n| `--opt-level, -O` | Optimization level (O0, O1, O2, O3, Os, Oz) - default: O2 |\n| `--warnings, -w` | Include conditional branch warnings |\n| `--func, -f` | Regex pattern to filter functions |\n| `--json` | Output JSON format |\n| `--github` | Output GitHub Actions annotations |\n| `--list-arch` | List supported architectures |\n\n### Examples\n\n```bash\n# Test with different optimization levels\nct-analyzer --opt-level O0 crypto.c\nct-analyzer --opt-level O3 crypto.c\n\n# Cross-compile for ARM64\nct-analyzer --arch arm64 crypto.c\n\n# Include conditional branch warnings\nct-analyzer --warnings crypto.c\n\n# Analyze specific functions\nct-analyzer --func 'decompose|sign' crypto.c\n\n# JSON output for CI\nct-analyzer --json crypto.c\n\n# Analyze Go code\nct-analyzer crypto.go\n\n# Analyze Rust code\nct-analyzer crypto.rs\n\n# Analyze PHP code (requires PHP with VLD extension or opcache)\nct-analyzer crypto.php\n\n# Analyze TypeScript (transpiles to JS first)\nct-analyzer crypto.ts\n\n# Analyze JavaScript (uses V8 bytecode analysis)\nct-analyzer crypto.js\n\n# Analyze Python (uses dis module for bytecode disassembly)\nct-analyzer crypto.py\n\n# Analyze Ruby (uses YARV instruction dump)\nct-analyzer crypto.rb\n```\n\n## Detected Vulnerabilities\n\n### Error-Level (Must Fix)\n\n| Category | x86_64 | ARM64 | RISC-V |\n|----------|--------|-------|--------|\n| Integer Division | DIV, IDIV, DIVQ, IDIVQ | UDIV, SDIV | DIV, DIVU, REM, REMU |\n| FP Division | DIVSS, DIVSD, DIVPS, DIVPD | FDIV | FDIV.S, FDIV.D |\n| Square Root | SQRTSS, SQRTSD, SQRTPS, SQRTPD | FSQRT | FSQRT.S, FSQRT.D |\n\n### Warning-Level (Review Needed)\n\nConditional branches that may leak timing if condition depends on secret data:\n\n- x86: JE, JNE, JZ, JNZ, JA, JB, JG, JL, etc.\n- ARM: BEQ, BNE, CBZ, CBNZ, TBZ, TBNZ\n- RISC-V: BEQ, BNE, BLT, BGE\n\n## Scripting Language Support\n\n### PHP Analysis\n\nPHP analysis uses either the VLD extension (recommended) or opcache debug output:\n\n**Detected PHP Vulnerabilities:**\n\n| Category | Pattern | Recommendation |\n|----------|---------|----------------|\n| Division | `ZEND_DIV`, `ZEND_MOD` | Use Barrett reduction |\n| Cache timing | `chr()`, `ord()` | Use `pack('C', $int)` / `unpack('C', $char)[1]` |\n| Table lookups | `bin2hex()`, `hex2bin()`, `base64_encode()` | Use constant-time alternatives |\n| Array access | `FETCH_DIM_R` (secret index) | Use constant-time table lookup |\n| Bit shifts | `ZEND_SL`, `ZEND_SR` (secret amount) | Mask shift amount |\n| Variable encoding | `pack()`, `serialize()`, `json_encode()` | Use fixed-length output |\n| Weak RNG | `rand()`, `mt_rand()`, `uniqid()` | Use `random_int()` / `random_bytes()` |\n| String comparison | `strcmp()`, `===` on secrets | Use `hash_equals()` |\n\n**Installation:**\n\n```bash\n# Install VLD extension (recommended)\n# Query latest version from PECL\nVLD_VERSION=$(curl -s https://pecl.php.net/package/vld | grep -oP 'vld-\\K[0-9.]+(?=\\.tgz)' | head -1)\npecl install channel://pecl.php.net/vld-${VLD_VERSION}\n\n# Or build from source (if PECL fails)\ngit clone https://github.com/derickr/vld.git && cd vld\nphpize && ./configure && make && sudo make install\n\n# Or use opcache (built-in, fallback)\n# Enabled by default in PHP 7+\n```\n\n### JavaScript/TypeScript Analysis\n\nJavaScript analysis uses V8 bytecode via Node.js `--print-bytecode`.

Cannot detect:\n   - Cache timing attacks from memory access patterns\n   - Microarchitectural side-channels (Spectre, etc.)\n   - Processor-specific optimizations\n\n2. **No Data Flow Analysis**: Flags all dangerous instructions regardless of whether they operate on secret data. Manual review is needed to determine if flagged code handles secrets. **This means false positives are expected** - for example, division used in loop bounds with public constants will be flagged even though it's not a vulnerability.\n\n3. **False Positive Verification**: For each flagged violation, verify the operands:\n   - If operands are compile-time constants or public parameters → likely false positive\n   - If operands are derived from keys, plaintext, or secrets → true positive\n   - See the SKILL.md documentation for detailed triage guidance\n\n4. **Compiler Variations**: Different compilers/versions may produce different assembly. Test with:\n   - Multiple optimization levels\n   - Multiple compilers\n   - Target production architectures\n\n5. **Scripting Languages**: PHP, JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, and Ruby are supported via bytecode analysis.\n\n## Running Tests\n\n```bash\npython3 ct_analyzer/tests/test_analyzer.py\n```\n\n## References\n\n- [Cryptocoding Guidelines](https://github.com/veorq/cryptocoding)\n- [KyberSlash Attack](https://kyberslash.cr.yp.to/)\n- [NIST FIPS 204: ML-DSA](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/204/final)\n- [Trail of Bits ML-DSA Implementation](https://github.com/trailofbits/ml-dsa)\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nBased on the [test_ct utility](https://github.com/trailofbits/ml-dsa/pull/16) created for ML-DSA.\n"

When Claude runs a bare `python`, `pip`, or `pipx` command, the shell resolves to the shim, which prints an error with the correct `uv` alternative and exits non-zero. `uv run` is unaffected because it prepends its managed virtualenv's `bin/` to PATH, shadowing the shims.\n\n| Intercepted Command | Suggested Alternative |\n|---------------------|----------------------|\n| `python ...` | `uv run python ...` |\n| `python -m module` | `uv run python -m module` |\n| `python -m pip` | `uv add`/`uv remove` |\n| `pip install pkg` | `uv add pkg` or `uv run --with pkg` |\n| `pip uninstall pkg` | `uv remove pkg` |\n| `pip freeze` | `uv export` |\n| `uv pip ...` | `uv add`/`uv remove`/`uv sync` |\n| `pipx install <pkg>` | `uv tool install <pkg>` |\n| `pipx run <pkg>` | `uvx <pkg>` |\n| `pipx uninstall <pkg>` | `uv tool uninstall <pkg>` |\n| `pipx upgrade <pkg>` | `uv tool upgrade <pkg>` |\n| `pipx upgrade-all` | `uv tool upgrade --all` |\n| `pipx ensurepath` | `uv tool update-shell` |\n| `pipx inject <pkg> <dep>` | `uv tool install --with <dep> <pkg>` |\n| `pipx list` | `uv tool list` |\n\nCommands like `grep python`, `which python`, and `cat python.txt` work normally because `python` is a shell argument, not the command being invoked.\n\n## Installation\n\n```\n/plugin install trailofbits/skills/plugins/modern-python\n```\n"
