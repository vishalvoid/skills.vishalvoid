    "skillMd": "---\nname: run-models\ndescription: Run AI models on Replicate via predictions, webhooks, and streaming.\n---\n\n## Docs\n\n- Reference: <https://replicate.com/docs/llms.txt>\n- OpenAPI schema: <https://api.replicate.com/openapi.json>\n- MCP server: <https://mcp.replicate.com>\n- Per-model docs: `https://replicate.com/{owner}/{model}/llms.txt`\n- Set `Accept: text/markdown` when requesting docs pages for Markdown responses.\n\n## Workflow\n\n1. **Choose the right model** - Search with the API or ask the user.\n2. **Get model metadata** - Fetch input and output schema via API.\n3. **Create prediction** - POST to /v1/predictions.\n4. **Poll for results** - GET prediction until status is \"succeeded\".\n5. **Return output** - Usually URLs to generated content.\n\n## Three ways to get output\n\n1. Create a prediction, store its id from the response, and poll until completion.\n2. Set a `Prefer: wait` header when creating a prediction for a blocking synchronous response. Only recommended for very fast models. Max 60 seconds.\n3. Set an HTTPS webhook URL when creating a prediction, and Replicate will POST to that URL when the prediction completes.\n\n## Guidelines\n\n- Use the `POST /v1/predictions` endpoint, as it supports both official and community models.\n- Every model has its own OpenAPI schema. Always fetch and check model schemas to make sure you're setting valid inputs. Even popular models change their schemas.\n- Validate input parameters against schema constraints (`minimum`, `maximum`, `enum` values). Don't generate values that violate them.\n- When unsure about a parameter value, use the model's default example or omit the optional parameter.\n- Don't set optional inputs unless you have a reason to. Stick to the required inputs and let the model's defaults do the work.\n- Use HTTPS URLs for file inputs whenever possible. You can also send base64-encoded files, but they should be avoided.\n- Fire off multiple predictions concurrently. Don't wait for one to finish before starting the next.\n- Output file URLs expire after 1 hour, so back them up if you need to keep them, using a service like Cloudflare R2.\n- Webhooks are a good mechanism for receiving and storing prediction output.\n\n## Predictions\n\n- A prediction goes through these states: `starting` -> `processing` -> `succeeded` / `failed` / `canceled`.\n- Official models use `owner/name` format. Community models require `owner/name:version_id`.\n- The `POST /v1/predictions` endpoint handles both.\n\n## Webhooks\n\n- Set `webhook` to an HTTPS URL when creating a prediction. Replicate POSTs the full prediction object when it completes.\n- Filter events with `webhook_events_filter`: `start`, `output`, `logs`, `completed`.\n- Validate webhook signatures using the `Webhook-ID`, `Webhook-Timestamp`, and `Webhook-Signature` headers. Get the signing secret from `GET /v1/webhooks/default/secret`.\n\n## Prediction lifetime\n\n- Set `lifetime` to auto-cancel predictions that run too long (e.g. `30s`, `5m`, `1h`). Measured from creation time.\n\n## Streaming\n\n- Language models that support streaming include a `stream` URL in the response. Use SSE to receive incremental output.\n\n## File handling\n\n- Prefer HTTPS URLs for file inputs. Output URLs from one prediction can be passed directly as file inputs to the next model.\n- Output file URLs expire after 1 hour. Download and store them immediately if you need to keep them.\n\n## Multi-model workflows\n\n- Chain models by passing output URLs as file inputs to the next model.\n- Start all independent predictions in parallel, then collect results.\n- Output URLs are valid for 1 hour, which is enough for pipeline steps.\n"
