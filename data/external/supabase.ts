Contains rules across 8 categories, prioritized by impact to guide automated query optimization and schema design.\n\n## When to Apply\n\nReference these guidelines when:\n- Writing SQL queries or designing schemas\n- Implementing indexes or query optimization\n- Reviewing database performance issues\n- Configuring connection pooling or scaling\n- Optimizing for Postgres-specific features\n- Working with Row-Level Security (RLS)\n\n## Rule Categories by Priority\n\n| Priority | Category | Impact | Prefix |\n|----------|----------|--------|--------|\n| 1 | Query Performance | CRITICAL | `query-` |\n| 2 | Connection Management | CRITICAL | `conn-` |\n| 3 | Security & RLS | CRITICAL | `security-` |\n| 4 | Schema Design | HIGH | `schema-` |\n| 5 | Concurrency & Locking | MEDIUM-HIGH | `lock-` |\n| 6 | Data Access Patterns | MEDIUM | `data-` |\n| 7 | Monitoring & Diagnostics | LOW-MEDIUM | `monitor-` |\n| 8 | Advanced Features | LOW | `advanced-` |\n\n## How to Use\n\nRead individual rule files for detailed explanations and SQL examples:\n\n```\nreferences/query-missing-indexes.md\nreferences/query-partial-indexes.md\nreferences/_sections.md\n```\n\nEach rule file contains:\n- Brief explanation of why it matters\n- Incorrect SQL example with explanation\n- Correct SQL example with explanation\n- Optional EXPLAIN output or metrics\n- Additional context and references\n- Supabase-specific notes (when applicable)\n\n## References\n\n- https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/\n- https://supabase.com/docs\n- https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Performance_Optimization\n- https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/overview\n- https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/row-level-security\n"
